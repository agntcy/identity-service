Agent Identity Service serves as the central hub for managing and verifying digital identities for your Agentic Services. In today's interconnected digital landscape, secure and reliable identity management is paramount. Agent Identity Service addresses this need by providing a streamlined service to:

- Verify the authenticity of existing identity badges.
- Register new Agentic Services, establishing their unique identities.
- Define TBAC (Task-Based Access Control) policies to govern access and permissions.

Whether you are integrating existing services or deploying new ones, Agent Identity Service ensures that all your components‚Äîincluding MCP Servers, A2A Agents, and OASF‚Äîare properly identified, managed and secured.

- **SDKs**: Libraries for various programming languages to interact with the Identity Service.
- **Docs**: Comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
- **Samples**: Example agents and MCP servers to demonstrate integration.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Get Started in 5 Minutes

This short guide allows you to setup the Identity Service `Frontend` as well as the Identity Service `Backend`.

### Prerequisites

To run these steps successfully, you need to have the following installed:

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), or have both: [Docker Engine v27 or higher](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose v2.35 or higher](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

1. Setup your OIDC Provider

   You can use any OIDC provider of your choice. For testing purposes, you can use [Ory](https://www.ory.sh/), [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) or [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).
   Configure the following variables in your shell environment:

   ```bash
   export OIDC_ISSUER_URL=<OIDC_ISSUER_URL>
   export OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<OIDC_CLIENT_ID>
   export OIDC_LOGIN_URL=<OIDC_LOGIN_URL>
   ```

   where:

   - `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` - The URL of your OIDC provider (e.g., `https://{INSTANCE_URL}/oauth2/{CLIENT_ID}/.well-known/openid-configuration`).
   - `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` - The client ID you created in your OIDC provider.
   - `OIDC_LOGIN_URL` - The login URL of your OIDC provider (e.g., `https://{INSTANCE_URL}/oauth2/{CLIENT_ID}/authorize`).

     > **üìù NOTE**
     > Make sure to add `http://localhost:5500` as a redirect URI for your OIDC client.

2. Start the Frontend and the Backend with Docker:

   ```bash
   ./deployments/scripts/launch.sh
   ```

   Or use `make` if available locally:

   ```bash
   make start
   ```

   > **üìù NOTE**
   > You can also install the `Backend` and the `Frontend` using our [help charts](charts).

3. Access the Frontend UI and the Backend APIs:

   - The Backend APIs will be available at: `http://localhost:4000` for REST and `http://localhost:4001` for gRPC.
   - The Frontend UI will be available at: `http://localhost:5500`.

## Development

- [Frontend](frontend/README.md)
- [Samples](samples/README.md)
- [Api Spec](backend/api/spec/README.md)
