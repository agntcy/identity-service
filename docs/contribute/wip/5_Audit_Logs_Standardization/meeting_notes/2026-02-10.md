# Notes

* Writing spec proposals: how do we do it?
  * Ask AGNTCY documentation group?
  * Start and fix it as we go!
* Suggestion: legal contacts to understand more about compliance professionals
* Worked on charter
* What standards should we look at?  Only open source or commercial as well?
  * What motivates these groups to want to adopt our proposals?
  * If we see something interesting in commercial software, is it something we are allowed to adopt / partner on?
