# Notes

* Reviewed last session’s meeting notes
* Reviewed auditing requirements document
* Privacy & Security
    * Compliance frameworks are interesting
* We should focus on areas where no one is working
    * Identity & AuthZ
        * Biggest challenge at the conference was “acting on behalf-of”
        * Many are doing impersonation (hand your personal creds to the agent)
        * Delegation chains (agent inheriting two roles)
            * Example: order a new laptop
            * Finance agent needs to check budget and need to check the employee’s context
            * In the end, it’s still token exchange
        * Customer conversations?
            * Who is using MAS systems and can we ask about their use cases
            * Action Item: Julu + Chun set up conversation with users
            * Action Item: are there any customers worried about compliance with AI acts?
* The rest of the meeting focused on a discussion of use cases and personas.  Here's what the group came up with for personas:

* Personas 
    * Higher priority - Identity 
        * Security Professionals 
            * Cares about:  
                * where did credentials come from,  
                * what type of credentials are they (service account, impersonation, on behalf of), 
                * which agent used it,  
                * what access does it represent (resource, internal vs external), 
                * what policies were enforced, and what was the verdict (both approved and rejected access) 
                * who is responsible for the system(s) in question (agent, resource, credential, etc.) 
                * audit logs are machine-readable, can be fed into agentic support systems 
        * Support Teams (audit-logs-as-training-data) 
        * Compliance Professionals 
            * Cares about: 
                * are the systems involved compliant with various frameworks 
                * what are the boundaries between internal and external systems
                * how is data transferred and across what geographies / jurisdictions 
                * how are privacy and security handled in the involved systems 
                * data retention and destruction (log storage) 
    * Lower priority (not a part of the identity working group)
        * Agent and Agentic Resource Developers
