# Notes

* Frameworks
    * AGNTCY Observe
        * Still needs user context
    * OpenTelemetry
        * How the above two are related / overlapping?
    * OASF / OCSF
    * Homegrown systems?
* What vs how?
    * Are we focused only on identity or the whole thing?
    * User context: whether the agent is acting on behalf of a user (delegation, impersonation)
    * Privacy?  Set aside for now, bring it in later
* Comparison to “normal” distributed systems
    * Deterministic vs stochastic
    * Why was the path chosen?  What other paths could have been taken?
* Problems we’re trying to solve
    * What are we expecting?
    * Capturing identity context
    * Capturing authorization context (was it OAuth? SAML? API token?)

Documents reviewed:
* https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans/
    * Seems like Otel’s conventions plus attributes to help record `slim`?

Action Items:

* Jim: NIST controls
* Alan: make a spreadsheet of frameworks and perform a gap assessment (check if there are already extensions)
* Alan: create a list of problems we’re trying to solve / capabilities we expect the framework to have
* Mohamed: Talk to Outshift folks working on Observe
* Mohamed: Test AGNTCY observe SDK for auditing capabilities
