# Subject Context Transfer

This Sub-Group (SG) addresses subject context transfers and bindings enabling policy decisions across a delegated chain that may involve users, agents, and tools. 
Issues like how such contexts should be embedded into tokens and leveraged to inform policy decision points, enable fine-grained authorization, traceability, and compliance are within the scope of this SG. 
This SG will also identify relevant standards, other ongoing initiatives, and push for new specs for the gaps identified.
