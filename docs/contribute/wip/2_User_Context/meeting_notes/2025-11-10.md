# Notes

## Discussed:

- Problem Statement and Goals
- Main Requirements Discussion
- Started analyzing existing standards and their limitations, in particular RFC 8693 OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange
  - Delegation vs impersonation
  - 4 main problems indetified:
	  1. Impersonation breaks context transfer visibility and policy controls
	  2. How to deal with partial grants to a subset of the resources requested and underscoping
	  3. Once the entity that exchanged the token got access to the subject's access token, it can keep reusing and exchanging it
	  4. The chain matters (sec anc compliance)
 		
# Next Steps

- Elaborate on the gaps and needs in terms of requirements
- Identify gaps that require new specs
- Keep discussing the role of other actors, such as approvers
- Discuss other standards and tech besides RFC 8693
