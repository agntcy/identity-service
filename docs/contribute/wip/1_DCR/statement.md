# DCR (Dynamic Client Registration)

Exploring mechanisms for agents, MCP servers, and tools to dynamically register themselves, such as:

- Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) as defined in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications,
- Client ID Metadata (OAuth Client ID Metadata Document).

This would reduce manual configuration and improve interoperability in distributed environments.
