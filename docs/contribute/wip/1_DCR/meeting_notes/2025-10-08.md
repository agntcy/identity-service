# Attendees
* Umesh (Sailpoint)
* Ankit (Skyfire)

# Notes
* We discussed DCR + Human Identity and the custom token exchange that we have implemented between KYA tokens and Access Tokens between Skyfire and Ory.
* We also explored whether DCR + Human Identity applies directly to AGNTCY or whether it stays with the IdP (we went with the former)
* Neither of us are experts on AGNTCY but it seems like the process should be
** IdP handles the DCR + Human Identity (KYA) -> Access Token exchange
** AGNTCY generates the applicable badges based on the ID from the IdP
*** If the IdP setup supports DCR + KYA, then the badge can include richer information about the agent, agent platform, and human / business principal
