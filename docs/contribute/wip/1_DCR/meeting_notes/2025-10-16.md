# Attendees
* Jean (Cisco)
* Jeff (Ory)
* Umesh (Sailpoint)
* Ankit (Skyfire)

# Notes
* Two levels of agent operations
  * Human-in-the-Loop
  * Autonomous
* Prefer to go with Client ID Metadata Document vs DCR
  * DCR is un-common
  * Client ID Metadata Document is the suggested successor to DCR and MCP is being guided towards it too
* KYA Provider (KYA Token Issuer) role
  * Issues KYA tokens to Agent Platforms and Agents
  * Agent Platforms and individual Agents can be OAuth Clients
* KYA tokens issued to Agent Platforms / OAuth Clients
  * Should be embedded in their Client ID Metadata Document
  * Should include the URI of the Client ID Metadata Document
    * I.e. Backlink for verification
    * Sub-claim of `apd` (Agent Platform Identity) claim
  * Authorization Servers can use the KYA information to
    * Make Client Registration decisions
    * Set default scopes
* KYA tokens issued to Agents
  * Should include the URI of the Client ID Metadata Document
    * Sub-claim of `apd` (Agent Platform Identity) claim
  * Enable Agents to create accounts and / or Login by performing a Token Exchange at the Authorization Server
    * `apd` claim in Agent’s KYA token matches apd claim in Agent Platform’s / OAuth Client’s KYA token
    * KYA Token <-> Access Token
    * For Autonomous agents, the authorization Server can assign the default scopes (above)
    * For HITL agents, the authorization Server can return the hyperlink to begin the authorization code flow
* Process to adding KYA information to AGNTCY
  * Register OAuth Client via Client ID Metadata Document at IdP
    * Client ID Metadata Document includes OAuth Client’s KYA token
  * Perform custom token exchange (KYA token <-> Access token) at IdP to Create Agent Account and/or Login Agent
    * `apd` claim in Agent’s KYA token matches apd claim in Agent Platform’s / OAuth Client’s KYA token
    * For Autonomous agents, the authorization Server can assign the default scopes (above)
    * For HITL agents, the authorization Server can return the hyperlink to begin the authorization code flow
  * IdP now allows for Services / Websites / MCP Servers / etc. to accept new Users as Customers
    * IdP has verified data about new Users
  * New and Existing Users are transparent to AGNTCY
    * AGNTCY can add KYA information (for User / Agent and Agent Platform) to Badges

# Next Steps
* Review / confirm / ratify Process to adding KYA information to AGNTCY
* Deep dive and spec out each step
* Invite Jeff (Ory) and Jean (Cisco) to contribute to KYAPay spec
* Build reference implementation jointly between AGNTCY, Cisco, Ory and Skyfire
