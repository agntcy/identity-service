# Proposal: Dynamic Client Registration of Agentic Services

## Current State

### Identity Provider (IdP) Integration

The `Identity Service` currently integrates IdPs (e.g. Okta, Duo, Ory...) using their specific APIs for the following functions:

- Registration of ClientCredentials for Agentic Services (Agents, MCP Servers): for each new Agentic Service, a new ClientCredential must be created in the IdP,
- Rotation of Secrets: when a ClientCredential's secret is rotated, the new secret must be updated in both the IdP and the Agentic Service.

### Badges and Signature

For each tenant, the `Identity Service` generates a key pair and uses it to sign and verify badges for Agentic Services. The keypair is stored in the `Identity Service` vault.

Identity Service->>Idp: Provision ClientCredentials
Idp->>Identity Service: ClientCredentials
Identity Service->>Identity Service: Store ClientCredentials in Vault
User->>Identity Service: Issue Badge for Agentic Service
Identity Service->>Identity Service: Issue JWT using ClientCredentials
note right of Identity Service: For Badge Proof
Identity Service->>Identity Service: Get PrivateKey from Vault
Identity Service->>Identity Node: Issue Badge using JWT
Identity Node->>Identity Node: Issue Badge with IdP as Issuer
Identity Node->>Identity Node: Sign the Badge using the PrivateKey
note right of Identity Node: Badge is a W3C Verifiable Credential

## Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) Proposal

To streamline the registration and management of Agentic Services, this proposal suggests implementing Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) as defined in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications. This would allow Agentic Services to register themselves dynamically with the `Identity Service`, reducing manual configuration and improving interoperability.

However, since there is a new alternative standard called Client ID Metadata (OAuth Client ID Metadata Document), we are considering this approach instead of the traditional DCR.

### Client ID Metadata Document Proposal

In the current design the IdP and its ClientCredentials are chained with the Badges in the following way:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    IdP-OAuth2 --> ClientCredentials --> JsonWebToken --> ClientId-Claim --> Badge-WellKnown --> IdP-Issuer
```

#### Metadata Document Structure

The Client Metadata must comply with the [OAuth Client ID Metadata Document](https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-parameters/oauth-parameters.xhtml#client-metadata).
The Client ID Metadata Document might contain the following fields:

- `client_id`: The unique identifier for the Agentic Service
- `client_name`: A human-readable name for the Agentic Service
- `token_endpoint_auth_method`: Use `private_key_jwt` for JWT-based authentication
- `jwks_uri`: The URI where the Agentic Service's public keys can be retrieved

#### New Flow Diagrams

##### Provisioning Agentic Service with Badge

```mermaid

Identity Service->>Idp: Issue JWT Access Token for Agentic Service
note right of Identity Service: Send the Metadata URI as Client ID
note right of Identity Service: Provide jwt_private_key_jwt authentication
Idp ->> Idp: Get the metadata document from the Metadata URI
note left of Idp: Retrieve the OAuth2 claims, including jwks_uri
Idp ->> Identity Service: Issue JWT Access Token
Identity Service->>Identity Service: Get PrivateKey from Vault
Identity Service->>Identity Node: Issue Badge using JWT
Identity Node->>Identity Node: Issue Badge with IdP as Issuer
Identity Node->>Identity Node: Sign the Badge using the PrivateKey
note right of Identity Node: Badge is a W3C Verifiable Credential
```

#### Agentic Service Access Token at Runtime

```

## Addons for draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00

The Client ID Metadata Document contains claims defined by
[IANA OAuth Dynamic Client Registration Metadata](https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-parameters/oauth-parameters.xhtml#client-metadata)
in relation with [RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591) and [RFC7592](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7592), such as `client_name`, `redirect_uris`, `token_endpoint_auth_method`, `jwks_uri`, etc.

These claims are OAuth2 generic and can be used in various contexts.
Specificially for Agentic Services, we can propose additional claims to enhance the functionality and interoperability of the services.

### Verifiable Credentials Extension (W3C)

The Agent Identity Service uses badges as Verifiable Credentials (VCs) based on the W3C VC Data Model.
A badge is issued by the Identity Provider (IdP) and signed using a private key stored in the Identity Service vault.
Its claims contains information about the Agentic Service, such as its identity (ResolverMetadataID), Agent Card Definition, MCP Server Tools and Resources.

In addition to send the keypair location using `jwks_uri`, we can propose to adding the signed badge (W3C Verifiable Credential) as an extension to the Client ID Metadata Document.
The VC can be verified therefore verified by the Identity Provider's Authorization Server using the public key retrieved from the `jwks_uri`.
Then Authorization Server might decide to include additional claims in the issued tokens based on the VC content.

The Client ID Metadata Document could now contain the following field:

- `vc+jwt`: A signed (W3C Verifiable Credential) in JOSE format.

Additional details in the flow diagram below:

```mermaid

Identity Service->>Idp: Issue JWT Access Token for Agentic Service
note right of Identity Service: Send the Metadata URI as Client ID
note right of Identity Service: For Runtime
Idp ->> Idp: Get the metadata document from the Metadata URI
note left of Idp: Retrieve the OAuth2 claims, including jwks_uri and the signed Badge (VC)
Idp ->> Idp: Verify the signed Badge (VC) using the public key from jwks_uri
note left of Idp: Inject other claims in the Access Token based on the Badge (VC) content
Idp ->> Identity Service: Issue JWT Access Token
```

### KYA (Know Your Agent) Extension (Skyfire)

KYA (Know Your Agent) is a Skyfire specification that links an Agentic Service to a verified person or business, ensuring trust and accountability in digital interactions.
Once verified, the agent receives a credential or token it can use to authenticate and make payments autonomously (KYA+pay).

A KYA token is a cryptographic credential issued by Skyfire that proves an AI agent’s verified identity and trust status.
It’s typically issued by a KYA Provider as a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) containing metadata about the agent (aid), user context and its verified owner (bid, ssi, btg).

To enhance the Client ID Metadata Document for Agentic Services, we can propose adding a KYA Token claim as an extension.

The Client ID Metadata Document could now contain the following field:

- `kya+jwt`: A signed KYA Token in JWT format.

The KYA Token could use the 'ResolverMetadataID' as the 'aid' (agent ID) claim to link the Agentic Service to its verified identity.

The identity chain would look like this:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    ClientID --> Metadata URI --> KYA --> AID --> Badge-WellKnown --> IdP-Issuer
```
