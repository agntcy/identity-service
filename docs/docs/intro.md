### What is Agent Identity?

Agent Identity serves as the central hub for managing and verifying digital identities for your Agentic Services. In today's interconnected digital landscape, secure and reliable identity management is paramount. Agent Identity addresses this need by providing a streamlined platform to:

- **Verify** the authenticity of existing identity badges.
- **Register** new Agentic Services, establishing their unique identities within the AGNTCY framework.

Whether you are integrating existing services or deploying new ones, Agent Identity ensures that all your components—including MCP Servers, A2A Agents, and OASF—are properly identified and managed.

### Getting Started with Agent Identity

To begin using Agent Identity's features, you have two primary pathways:

1.  **Verify Existing Identities**: If you already possess identity badges for your Agentic Services, you can use Agent Identity to verify their authenticity and integrate them into the system.
2.  **Register New Agentic Services**: For new deployments or services that require a fresh identity, Agent Identity facilitates the registration process, allowing you to create and manage their digital presence.

### Key Functionalities

Agent Identity is structured around two core functionalities to cater to different identity management needs:

#### 1. Verify Identities

This functionality is designed for users who need to confirm the legitimacy of pre-existing identities.

- **Purpose**: To validate and integrate identities for your deployed Agentic Services.
- **Scope**: Primarily focuses on verifying identities associated with:
  - **MCP Servers** (Management Control Plane Servers)
  - **A2A Agents** (Agent-to-Agent communication entities)
  - **OASF** (Open Agent Service Framework)
- **Action**: Initiate the verification process by clicking the "**Verify Identity**" button. This will guide you through the steps required to authenticate your existing identities.

#### 2. Create Identities

This functionality empowers users to establish new identities and define their associated access controls.

- **Purpose**: To provision and manage new digital identities for Agentic Services.
- **Scope**: Allows you to add and configure identities for:
  - **MCP Servers**
  - **A2A Agents**
  - **OASF**
- **Management**: Beyond creation, this section enables you to:
  - **Manage identities**: Update, modify, or revoke existing identities.
  - **Define TBAC Rules and Policies**: Implement Trust-Based Access Control rules to govern how your Agentic Services interact and access resources, ensuring secure and compliant operations.
- **Action**: To create new identities or manage existing ones, you will typically need to "**Log In**" to your Agent Identity account. If you are a new user, you can "**Sign Up**" to create an account and begin leveraging these features.

### Accessing Agent Identity

Access to Agent Identity's full suite of features, particularly for creating and managing identities, requires user authentication.

- **Log In**: If you already have an Agntcy account, use the "**Log In**" option to access your dashboard and manage your Agentic Service identities.
- **Sign Up**: If you are new to Agent Identity, select "**Sign Up**" to create a new account and begin your journey with secure identity management.
