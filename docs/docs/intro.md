### What is the Agent Identity Service?

Agent Identity Service serves as the central hub for managing and verifying digital identities for your Agentic Services. In today's interconnected digital landscape, secure and reliable identity management is paramount. Agent Identity Service addresses this need by providing a streamlined service to:

- **Verify** the authenticity of existing identity badges.
- **Register** new Agentic Services, establishing their unique identities.

Whether you are integrating existing services or deploying new ones, Agent Identity Service ensures that all your components—including MCP Servers, A2A Agents, and OASF—are properly identified and managed.

### Getting Started with Agent Identity Service

To begin using Agent Identity Service's features, you have two primary pathways:

1.  **Verify Existing Identities**: If you already possess identity badges for your Agentic Services, you can use Agent Identity Service to verify their authenticity and integrate them into the system.
2.  **Register New Agentic Services**: For new deployments or services that require a fresh identity, Agent Identity Service facilitates the registration process, allowing you to create and manage their digital presence.

### Key Functionalities

Agent Identity Service is structured around two core functionalities to cater to different identity management needs:

#### 1. Verify Identities

This functionality is designed for users who need to confirm the legitimacy of pre-existing identities.

- **Purpose**: To validate and integrate identities for your deployed Agentic Services.
- **Scope**: Primarily focuses on verifying identities associated with:
  - **MCP Servers** (Model Context Protocol)
  - **A2A Agents** (Agent-to-Agent communication entities)
  - **OASF** ([Open Agentic Schema Framework](https://github.com/agntcy/oasf))
- **Action**: Initiate the verification process by clicking the "**Verify Identity**" button. This will guide you through the steps required to authenticate your existing identities.

#### 2. Create Identities

This functionality empowers developers to establish new identities for their AI Agents and MCP Servers and define their associated access controls.

- **Purpose**: To provision and manage new digital identities for Agentic Services.
- **Scope**: Allows you to add and configure identities for:
  - **MCP Servers**
  - **A2A Agents**
  - **OASF**
- **Management**: Beyond creation, this section enables you to:
  - **Manage identities**: Update, modify, or revoke existing identities.
  - **Define `TBAC` Rules and Policies**: Implement Task-Based Access Control rules to govern how your Agentic Services interact and access resources, ensuring secure and compliant operations.
- **Action**: To create new identities or manage existing ones, you will typically need to "**Log In**" to your Agent Identity Service account. If you are a new user, you can "**Sign Up**" to create an account and begin leveraging these features.

### Accessing Agent Identity Service

Access to Agent Identity Service's full suite of features, particularly for creating and managing identities, requires user authentication.

- **Log In**: If you already have an account, use the "**Log In**" option to access your dashboard and manage your Agentic Service identities.
- **Sign Up**: If you are new to Agent Identity Service, select "**Sign Up**" to create a new account and begin your journey with secure identity management.
